              <h5>Thousands of ancient greek findings visualised in a dynamic representation by combining the current system with modern age technologies.</h5>
              <p>
                ThorikΩs is a project created for the Information Design course of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences The ThorikΩs visualization was created in
                collaboration with the UU. Thorikos was a city in the southern portion of ancient Attica. There have been found all sorts of objects from ancient Greece
                in this area. These findings consist mostly of shards of objects like tiles, amphora's, jugs and cups.
              </p>
              <p>
                The findings have been categorized and are visualized manually. Creating those visualizations takes a lot of work which is why this project is created.
                With the ThorikΩs project, we can dynamically create map views of specific findings. Like Amphora found in 2013, poorly reserved grinding stones with a
                black glaze or drinking vessels from the Archaic period.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project was received with pleasure by teachers and more importantly the client. We received the highest possible grade, a 10, and the project was
                chosen as most useful by the client. The tool is now being used by the ThorikΩs team to gain new insights.

                  You start with the entire collection. This is represented by the green rectangle. You can divide the collection into categories seen below. For example,
                  when you click shape objects, you will see the main objects like tiles, amphora's, jugs and cups.

                  These can then be discovered further. Once you click one of these objects you will reduce the objects to your selection. This process can be repeated
                  over and over until there are no more findings.

                  This tool is an interactive version of two tools combined. The first is the original map with grid system of Thorikos. This was a analog system and
                  needed to be digitalised. This new digital system is then combined with a interactive treemap. The treemap was “hacked” to become a filter system.

                  The Thorikos site has tons of variables of which we choose the 7 most important. Some of these had 100+ sub-categories. The interactive treemap can
                  store all these variables and serve an unique map view for each selection.

            We crafted a puzzle which matched the digital product. You can follow along with this puzzle by taking filtering the data on the site. At the last step you
            see 4 findings at the same location as the site in Thorikos. The puzzle is created by lasercutting and engraving.

                  We've added breadcrumbs to keep track of where you currently are in the collection. These can be found in the upper-left area above the visualizations.
                  Every time you browse the collection it's stored and shown here. The breadcrumbs are interactive in both the collection view and map view. Once you
                  click them you navigate to that selection.
