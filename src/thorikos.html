            <h5>Thorikos is a series of projects in which UI interactions are explored through visual design and code.</h5>
            <p>
              It now consist of 16+ conceptual projects. The first project was uploaded in the end of 2018. Each project has a different concept but needs to involve an
              unique mechanic, interaction or effect. Some projects were just fun to create and didn‚Äôt take that much. Others were very personal and served as a type of
              therapy. These projects involve copy I personally wrote to understand the world around me better.

                I was exploring some designs styles with the images of the project ripe from Evelyn Bencicova. I knew I wanted to use a high contrast element along with
                the photography. Like a bright color or a typeface with a lot of character. Because if I wouldn't, the design would feel like a mourning card ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

                The Gothic typeface works great with the models. The main focus is therefore mainly on the photography. The rest of the UI is kept fairly minimal, by the
                use of low contrast which is created through small typefaces and a two-color, color-palette.

          We crafted a puzzle which matched the digital product. You can follow along with this puzzle by taking filtering the data on the site. At the last step you see
          4 findings at the same location as the site in Thorikos. The puzzle is created by lasercutting and engraving.
