                therapy. These projects involve copy I personally wrote to understand the world around me better.

                  I was exploring some designs styles with the images of the project ripe from
                  <a href="http://evelynbencicova.com/" target="_blank"> Evelyn Bencicova</a>. I knew I wanted to use a high contrast element along with the photography.
                  Like a bright color or a typeface with a lot of character. Because if I wouldn't, the design would feel like a mourning card ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

                  The Gothic typeface works great with the models. The main focus is therefore mainly on the photography. The rest of the UI is kept fairly minimal, by
                  the use of low contrast which is created through small typefaces and a two-color, color-palette.

                  The colors were inspired from the image itself. The color palette is restricted to only two colors. During this time I was exploring ways to incorporate
                  color in various ways. Usually I mostly use black, white and a single color.

                  This one is a more personal project. The concept is the lost of a passion. It's a horrible empty feeling. This project was like therapy. By working on
                  it I refound parts of my passion. It was created after a while of not feeling able to do anything. The title is inspired by this: "without language
                  there is no thought". Without is replaced with the french word "sans" also from sans-serif.

                  important in the project. The answer was project a like this. Combining visual design with creative coding, talking about something that is personal.
                  Using large type, interesting layouts and unique interactions.

                  Aren't radial transitions dope? I think so at least. The concept behind this one is a minimal layout with focus on the feature images. The feature image
                  is a composition of a portait with floral background.
