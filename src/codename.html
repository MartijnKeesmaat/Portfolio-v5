              <h5>Codename is a series of projects in which UI interactions are explored through visual design and code.</h5>
              <p>
                It now consists of 16+ conceptual projects. The first project was uploaded at the end of 2018. Each project has a different concept but involves a unique
                mechanic, interaction, or effect. There will be a preview of a selection of projects, since the page would otherwise be huge.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are my most personal projects and align the most with what type of work I want to create. It's the combining of various ways of creating which makes
                it such a fun type of project to work on. In the future, I want to involve 3D, WebGL, canvas for the tech-side, and more unique and meaningful experiences
                on the conceptual side concepts.

                  I was exploring some design styles with the images of the project ripe from
                  <a href="http://evelynbencicova.com/" target="_blank"> Evelyn Bencicova</a>. I knew I wanted to use a high contrast element along with the photography.
                  Like a bright color or a typeface with a lot of character. Because if I wouldn't, the design would feel like a mourning card ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

                  The Gothic typeface works great with the models. The main focus is therefore mainly on photography. The rest of the UI is kept fairly minimal, by the
                  use of low contrast which is created through small typefaces and a two-color, color-palette.

                  A CSS Grid-based slideshow with a layer motion effect on the main image and title. When scrolling through the photography section of Behance, I found

                  The colors were inspired from the image itself. The color palette is restricted to only two colors. During this time I was exploring ways to incorporate
                  color in various ways. Usually I mostly use black, white and a single color.

                  This one is a more personal project. The project is inspired by the idea of losing a passion. It's a horrible empty feeling. Working on it was like
                  therapy. Through the process, I refound parts of my love for creating. It was created after a while of not feeling able to do anything. The title is
                  inspired by this: "without language, there is no thought". Without is replaced with the french word "sans" from sans-serif, since it's a type-focussed
                  project.

                  I reflected on the projects which used to give me energy by writing. Writing has been a great way to explore those thoughts. Which is also why type is
                  important in the project. The answer was a project like this. Combining visual design with creative coding, talking about something that is personal to
                  me. Using large typography, interesting layouts, and unique interactions.

                  Aren't radial transitions dope? I think so at least. The concept behind this one is a minimal layout with a focus on the feature images. The featured
                  image is a composition of a portrait with a floral background.
