              <h5>Red, the color of death and courage. Celebration and festivity. Wealth and status and also the topic of this project.</h5>
              <p>
                This project is a color study regarding the color red. Red is known for its bipolar qualities, being known for aggression as well as love. With this
                project, we look beyond those known qualities and dive deep into the history of the color.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this case study, we start with historic research. The main resource for this is the book: the secret lives colors. We learn that red was a symbol
                of wealth. It was worn by roman cardinals, used to decorate villas and manuscript capitals. During this time it was as valuable as gold and lapis lazuli.

                  4 themes arose during the research. Red is a color that was often seen as the color of death, a sign of courage, as a color for celebration, or as a
                  symbol of status. From these topics, I choose Wealth & Status.

                  During the research, I got excited about this topic the most. I loved learning about the history, how they made dye of the color, why people wore it,
                  and what it meant to them.

                  The style of this project is based on this little bug here. Also known as cochineal or kermes. The Romans used to import this bug from Spain. They used
                  this bug to create a red dye. It took 7000 of these little bugs to create one pound of dye. Making it as valuable as gold and lapis lazuli at the time.
                  Red was worn by cardinals, wealthy merchants and royalty.

                  From that inspiration, I started looking at how red was used during those times. I noticed that it was often used for clothing. Red was also used in
                  type like in manuscript capitals, along with gold and lapis lazuli.

                  The goal of the screens was to embody the wealth & status theme. The type is proudly displayed in a large type full of character. The interface is rich
                  with imagery and typography to highlight those images. The images are gracefully styled with ornaments based on the curves of wealthy architecture. The
                  grid structure is complex at points to create a visually stimulating experience for the user.
