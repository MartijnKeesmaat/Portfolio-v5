                During the Minor Visual (Interface) Design we were asked to pick a piece of artwork (poster, album cover etc.) and translate that to the web. First try to
                re-create it with web technology (html elements, svg) then add interactivity and animation and maybe you can even enhance the artwork with elements in the
                same graphical style as the original work. You can use CSS and SVG to create these animations.
              </p>
              <p>
                That sounded like a fun exercise but I needed a challenge. I found the book of a cover which is simply a grid of dots and said to myself "what is the
                coolest thing I can make?". This question let me down a rabbit-hole that is creative coding, physics, and animation.

                  Repulsion. It is a term I found after looking online which could be the answer to how to create the effect I initially had in mind. This term led me to
                  the book Nature of Code which explains how this term works.

                  A random walker is an entity that follows a path based on a randomly generated input. This one simply draws a single point moves 5 steps and draws
                  another.

                  The second chapter teaches us about vectors. Vectors are a basic building block in creative coding. Some people explain it very complex. I just see it
                  as something that groups values. Instead of having multiple variables for position, you can group those into one vector. - position(x, y)

                  The experiment you see here is fairly simple. It calculates the distance of a particle between it and the position of the cursor. Then subtract that a
                  bit for each frame. Repeat that for 50 particles and you get something like this.

                  In the past chapters we moved objects by updating the position with velocity and acceleration. However, the limiting factor was that these values were
                  arbitrary. With forces we give some reason for those values. Like you see here with gravitational forces.

                  This one is more complex than the previous one as we use two clasess which need to communicate with each other. The attractor class and the particle
                  class. The particle is passed as an argument to the attractor.

                  A particle system it a system of many objects. Each object sharing similar attributes. In this chapter we learn how to maintain those systems. Here we
                  introduce a lifecycle for each particle to keep things running smoothly.

                  The experiment that is shown here isn't that fancy. It's main purpose is to demonstrate an infinite source of generated particles which still runs
                  smoothly. This is because of the introduction of the lifecycle.
